                The town lies in a natural three-forked valley at the confluence of the River Brun and the River Calder, surrounded by
                open fields, with wild moorland at higher altitudes. To the west of Burnley lie the towns of Padiham, Accrington and
                Blackburn, with Nelson and Colne to the north. The centre of the town stands at approximately 387 feet (118 m) above sea
                level and 30 miles (48 km) east of the Irish Sea coast.

                Areas in the town include: Burnley Wood, Rose Hill, Healey Wood, Harle Syke, Haggate, Daneshouse, Stoneyholme, Burnley
                Lane, Heasandford, Brunshaw, Pike Hill, Gannow, Ightenhill, Whittlefield, Rose Grove, Habergham, and Lowerhouse.
                Although Reedley is considered to be a suburb of the town, it is actually part of the neighbouring borough of Pendle.

                Burnley has a temperate maritime climate, with relatively cool summers and mild winters. There is regular but generally
                light precipitation throughout the year, contributing to a relatively high humidity level. While snowfall occasionally
                occurs during the winter months, the temperature is rarely low enough for it to build up on the ground in any quantity.
                The town is believed to be the first place in the UK where regular rainfall measurements were taken (by Richard
                Towneley, beginning in 1677).
