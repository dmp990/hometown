            <p>Burnley is a town and the administrative centre of the wider Borough of Burnley in Lancashire, England,
            with a 2001 population of 73,021. It is 21 miles (34 km) north of Manchester and 20 miles (32 km) east of Preston, at
            the confluence of the River Calder and River Brun.
            
            The town is located near the countryside to the south and east, with the towns of Padiham and Brierfield to the west and
            north respectively. It has a reputation as a regional centre of excellence for the manufacturing and aerospace
            industries.
            
            The town began to develop in the early medieval period as a number of farming hamlets surrounded by manor houses and
            royal forests, and has held a market for more than 700 years. During the Industrial Revolution it became one of
            Lancashire's most prominent mill towns; at its peak, it was one of the world's largest producers of cotton cloth and a
            major centre of engineering.
            
            Burnley has retained a strong manufacturing sector, and has strong economic links with the cities of Manchester and
            Leeds, as well as neighbouring towns along the M65 corridor. In 2013, in recognition of its success, Burnley received an
            Enterprising Britain award from the UK Government, for being the "Most Enterprising Area in the UK". For the first
            time in more than fifty years, a direct train service now operates between the town's Manchester Road railway station
            and Manchester's Victoria station, via the newly restored Todmorden Curve, which opened in May 2015.</p>
