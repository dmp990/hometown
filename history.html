            <h2>Origins</h2>
            <p>Stone Age flint tools and weapons have been found on the moors around the town, as have numerous tumuli, stone
            circles, and some hill forts (see: Castercliff, which dates from around 600 BC). Modern-day Back Lane, Sump Hall Lane
            and Noggarth Road broadly follow the route of a classic ridgeway running east–west to the north of the town, suggesting
            that the area was populated during pre-history and probably controlled by the Brigantes.
            
            Limited coin finds indicate a Roman presence, but no evidence of a settlement has been found in the town. Gorple Road
            (running east from Worsthorne) appears to follow the route of a Roman road that may have crossed the present-day centre
            of town, on the way to the fort at Ribchester. It has been claimed that the nearby earthworks of Ring Stones Camp
            (53.793°N 2.174°W), Twist Castle (53.800°N 2.171°W) and Beadle Hill (53.803°N 2.169°W) are of Roman origin, but
            little supporting archaeological information has been published.
            
            Following the Roman period, the area became part of the kingdom of Rheged, and then the kingdom of Northumbria. Local
            place-names Padiham and Habergham show the influence of the Angles, suggesting that some had settled in the area by the
            early 7th century; sometime later the land became part of the hundred of Blackburnshire.
            
            There is no definitive record of a settlement until after the Norman conquest of England. In 1122, a charter granted the
            church of Burnley to the monks of Pontefract Abbey. In its early days, Burnley was a small farming community, gaining
            a corn mill in 1290, a market in 1294, and a fulling mill in 1296. At this point, it was within the manor of
            Ightenhill, one of five that made up the Honor of Clitheroe, then a far more significant settlement, and consisted of no
            more than 50 families. Little survives of early Burnley apart from the Market Cross, erected in 1295, which now stands
            in the grounds of the old grammar school.
            
            Over the next three centuries, Burnley grew in size to about 1,200 inhabitants by 1550, still centred around the church,
            St Peter's, in what is now known as "Top o' th' Town". Prosperous residents built larger houses, including Gawthorpe
            Hall in Padiham and Towneley Hall. In 1532, St Peter's Church was largely rebuilt. Burnley's grammar school was founded
            in 1559, and moved into its own schoolhouse next to the church in 1602. Burnley began to develop in this period into a
            small market town, with a population of not more that 2,000 by 1790. It is known that weaving was established in the
            town by the middle of the 18th century, and in 1817 a new Market House was built. The town continued to be centred on St
            Peter's Church, until the market was moved to the bottom of what is today Manchester Road, at the end of the 19th
            century.</p>

            <h2>Industrial Revolution</h2>
            <p>
                In the second half of the 18th century, the manufacture of cotton began to replace wool. Burnley's earliest known
                factories – dating from the mid-century – stood on the banks of the River Calder, close to where it is joined by the
                River Brun, and relied on water power to drive the spinning machines. The first turnpike road through the area now known
                as Burnley was begun in 1754, linking the town to Blackburn and Colne eventually leading to the area of Brun Lea
                developing into a town, and by the mid 19th century, there were daily stagecoach journeys to Blackburn, Skipton and
                Manchester, the latter taking just over two hours.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The 18th century also saw the rapid development of coal mining on the Burnley Coalfield: the drift mines and shallow
                bell-pits of earlier centuries were replaced by deeper shafts, meeting industrial as well as domestic demand in Nelson,
                Colne & Padiham, and by 1800 there were over a dozen pits in the modern-day centre of the town alone.
            </p>
            <p>
                The arrival of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in 1796 made possible transportation of goods in bulk, bringing a huge
                boost to the area's economy and the town of Burnley was born. Dozens of new mills were constructed, along with many
                foundries and ironworks that supplied the cotton mills and coal mines with machinery and cast and wrought iron for
                construction. The town became renowned for its mill-engines, and the Burnley Loom was recognised as one of the best in
                the world.
            </p> 
            <p>
                A permanent military presence was established in the town with the completion of Burnley Barracks in 1820.
            </p>
            <p>
                Disaster struck the town in 1824, when first its only local bank (known as Holgate's) collapsed, forcing the closure
                of some of the largest mills. This was followed by a summer drought, which caused serious problems for many of the
                others, leading to high levels of unemployment and possibly contributing to the national financial crisis of 1825.
            </p>
            <p>
                By 1830, there were 32 steam engines in cotton mills throughout the rapidly expanding town, an example of which,
                originally installed at Harle Syke Mill, is on display in the Science Museum in London.
            </p>
            <p>
                Around 1840, a traveller described the town as ugly, stating that: "parts of it were so situated that good architectural
                effects might have been obtained had the disposition and the resources co-existed".
            </p>
            <p>
                The Great Famine of Ireland led to an influx of Irish families during the 1840s, who formed a community in one of the
                poorest districts. At one time, the Park District (modern-day town centre, around Parker St.) was known as Irish Park.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1848, the East Lancashire Railway Company's extension from Accrington linked the town to the nation's nascent railway
                network for the first time. This was another significant boost to the local economy and, by 1851, the town's population
                had reached almost 21,000.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Burnley Building Society, incorporated in Burnley in 1850, was, by 1911, not only 'by far the largest in the County
                of Lancashire... but the sixth in magnitude in the kingdom'.
            </p>
            <p>
                The start of the 20th century saw Burnley's textile industry at the height of its prosperity. By 1901 there were 700,000
                spindles and 62,000 looms at work in the textile industry. Other industries at that time included: brass and iron
                foundries, rope works, calico printing works, tanneries, paper mills, collieries and corn mills and granaries. By
                1910, there were approximately 99,000 power looms in the town, and it reached its peak population of over 100,000 in
                1911. By 1920, the Burnley and District Weavers', Winders' and Beamers' Association had more than 20,000
                members. However, the First World War heralded the beginning of the collapse of the English textiles industry and
                the start of a steady decline in the town's population.[18] The Bank Parade drill hall was completed in the early 20th
                century.

                There is a total of 191 Listed buildings in Burnley – one Grade I (Towneley Hall), two Grade II (St Peter's Church and
                Burnley Mechanics) and 188 Grade II.
